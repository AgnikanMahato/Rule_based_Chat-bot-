# Rule_based_Chat-bot-
I will show you how to build your very own chatbot using Python. There are broadly two variants of chatbots, Rule-based and Self-learning. A rule-based bot uses some rules on which it is trained, while a self-learning bot uses some machine-learning-based approach to chat.

# Setting Up the Basics:
We start the code by importing the necessary modules from NLTK, a powerful library for natural language processing. Chat is used to create our chatbot, while reflections help in mirroring user inputs.

# Defining Patterns and Responses:
We define a list called pairs, which consists of tuples. Each tuple contains a pattern and a corresponding response. The patterns are regular expressions used to identify user inputs, and the responses are what the chatbot will reply with.

# Creating the Chat Object:
We initialize the Chat object with our defined patterns and responses. This object will handle the conversation flow based on the given rules.

# Starting the Conversation:
Finally, we start the chatbot's conversation loop. This function allows the chatbot to continuously interact with the user until they decide to exit.

# Key Highlights:
1. Pattern Matching: Using regular expressions to match user queries.
2. Custom Responses: Providing specific answers based on the identified patterns.
3. Interactive Dialogue: Engaging in a conversation by handling various user inputs.
 
This project has been a fantastic learning experience and a great way to get acquainted with chatbot development. I hope this breakdown helps anyone interested in diving into the world of NLP and chatbot creation!
